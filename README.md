# Hide-and-Seek

I made a game imitating a boardgame (Pirates Jr - Hide & Seek) in C++. It has a game board that contains 4 mini-maps (they contain boats with white/black flags, chests and other objects) and 4 pieces in different shapes. These pieces can rotate from left to right. The goal of the game is to display certain objects from those mini maps in the conditions in which we have to put these pieces on the mini maps. We are not allowed to display objects other than those mentioned at the beginning of the round (with the exception of water).
